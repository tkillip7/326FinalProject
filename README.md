        # So,
# We're going to have a 1v1 game, where player chooses a pokemon and computer
# chooses pokemon.

# When we run the program, it'll start like this (refer to turn methods):

# Hello Human!
# Please enter your name: (input)
# What's up (input)!

# Computer needs a name!
# Please enter Computer's name: (input)
# What's up (input).....
#
# Player 1, please choose a pokemon (give a list of names, if name )
#                                   (isn't valid, tell user to enter again)
#
# Based on the input, create a Pokemon object based on that
#
# What pokemon will Player 2 have?
# Based on the input, create a Pokemon object based on that
#
#
# The Pokemon have been selected!
# It's (Player 1's pokemon) vs (Player 2's pokemon)!
#
#
# Player 1, what move will you choose? Present the pokemon's movelist
# and have player 1 input what move they want, if playeer misspells or
# enters a wrong move, tell player that it's not a valid choice
#
# Player 2, what move will you choose? Same as player 1 instructions.
#
# Whichever pokemon is faster (compare speeds), they attack first
#
#
# Terminal will print, (Player's pokemon) used (move)! (Other player's pokemon)
# has (health) left!
#
# and then same for opposing pokemon, this continues until health is 0
#
#
# Here, we can just display a graph of some sort for pandas just for no reason
#
# Then ask user if he wants to reset, if "yes", then reset, else, say "goodbye"
#
