This repository is made to hold the semester python project created by: Vinny Tran, Guillermo Ortiz, Trinity Kiilip, and Daniel Gonzalez. (INST326 – 0101)

Our team name is Football, although we changed our project idea to a Pokémon player versus computer based game that takes place in the terminal.  

The files in our repository and the reason for their inclusion are as follows;

Pokemon_Moves.csv:  This CSV file hold the attributes of each move for each Pokémon we included.

Pokemons.csv:       This CSV file holds the attributes for each individual Pokémon we included.

Pokemon.py:         This file contains the actual python program.


To run the code, one you are in the same directory of where all the files are being kept, in the terminal insert and run “python pokemon.py” if on windows or “python3 pokemon.py” if on mac.

• Clear instructions on how to use your program and/or interpret the output of the program, as applicable


• Attributions: 

Trinity: 

Daniel: In the fight method, Daniel took care of the regex that was used to take in the Pokemon_Moves.csv file and created nested dictionaries for each Pokémon. This allowed for easy access to each Pokémon’s each moves and the move’s values.  Daniel also wrote the statuses method and stall method. These methods were to help immerse to the player in hope that it feels like the computer is another player. The stall method uses the sleep() method from the time library[1].
